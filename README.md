Currently, there are few things to customize in the base file. I added a few things before releasing it so it's not boring, but I hope it at least inspires you to make your own stuff! It feels good to have an OC be represented, don't let what's currently in this SVG limit your creativity! :D

# Additional Information

## Naming schemes
"Left" refers to character's left, viewer's right.  
"Right" refers to character's right, viewer's left.  
Names may be imperfect and subject to change, sorry for any confusion! I tried to label as best I could.

## Credits
Any mentions of "LCC" are shorthand for "LittleCuteCorpse". Also recognized online as "LittleCuteThing", "LittleDeadlyThing", and "Disease".  

Pretty Blood, its characters, and the malino and blubby species wholly belong to user LittleCuteCorpse on Newgrounds.  
This is fan work and should NOT be referred to in any way as official.

Plug and play Unity application is being *considered*, nothing promised at this time.  

Alternate poses and animation are not planned for any web or app release.  
Back-view is currently not planned nor included in SVG.  
Side-view is currently not planned nor included in SVG.  

There are no plans or intentions for ANY monetization on any potential future web or app releases.  
Additionally, no Patreon or Ko-Fi will be used to support work on this small project. I want to continue this as a passion project, I'm worried I'll lose passion if money is involved.  
Please, at least until I understand it, do not buy or sell assets for this SVG or any potential future web or app releases.  

Thank you for reading, have fun! If you have any questions, concerns, or requests for features, it's not too hard to find a place to contact me. I'm most active on Discord! :D
